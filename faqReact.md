- Npm vs Npx

  - Npm: npm install -g create-react-app & create-react-app my-app
  - Npx: npx create-react-app my-app

- Statement and Expression

  - statement: Do something (x=1)
  - Expression: Produces something (x+1)

- {} in jsx are used to write js expression with jsx

- regular function and arrow function in events

  ```
  const button = document.querySelector('button')
  button.addEventListener('click',event=>console.log(event)) [works]
  button.addEventListener('click',function(event){console.log(event)}) [works]

  ```

- When do react re-render?

  - State changes
  - Prop changes

- Difference between primitive value and reference value

  - Compares value directly in primitive value
  - Check by reference in reference value

- Functional updates with set function preventing race condition

  - React uses batch updates to update all set functions at once, instead of repeating multiple times.

- Spread Operator

  - Parent Components

  ```
    <SocialLink {...link} />

    is equivalent to

    <SocialLink id={link.id}  href={link.href} name={link.name}/>
  ```

  - Child Components

  ```
  const SocialLink = () => {
     ...
     return(...)
  }
  ```

- Side effects :

  - React's main job is to take the component's data (state, props) and render the UI on the screen.
  - Side Effects: Think of side effects as anything extra that React doesnâ€™t manage by default! (like fetching data, logging, or manipulating the DOM). Need to code yourself and explicitly tell React when and how to handle them.
  - Side effects trigger changes in state or props, and React responds to those changes by re-rendering.
  - That's why side effects are kept separate and managed with tools like useEffect

- Multiple return contains at least three states e.g. isLoading, isError, data

- onChange, OnSubmit, OnClick

- useState passing objects vs useState passes value

  - Use objects for more complex state that involves multiple related values.

  - Parent component
    - When handlers are called in the child components, they trigger the state update functions in the parent component. The state is updated in the parent component even though the handlers are executed in the child components.
